# obsidian-imdb-importer
This script takes your IMDb ratings CSV export and converts each movie or TV show into a clean, structured Markdown file for Obsidian. It enriches your data using the OMDb API, intelligently caches results to avoid duplicate requests, and keeps your Obsidian vault up to date with minimal API calls.
