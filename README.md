A Bash script that parses your personal IMDb CSV list and enriches each entry using the OMDb API, generating well-structured Markdown files for use in Obsidian.

## Output Structure

Markdown files are saved into your Obsidian vault under separate folders for movies and TV shows:

```
/Vaults/Jojo/04 - Entertainment/01 - TV/

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Breaking Bad.md

```

Each `.md` file contains:

- YAML frontmatter with structured metadata

Open the script and edit the following variables:

```bash
CSV_FILE="imdb_list.csv"                     # Your exported IMDb CSV
